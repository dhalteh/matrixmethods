# matrixmethods
An object-oriented approach to matrix operations in C++.

1.	Allow the user to input values to create an n x n matrix (i.e. square).

2.	Allow the user to perform one of three possible elementary operations.

a)	Multiply a row by a constant, non-zero value.

b)	Swap any two rows. 

c)	Take a row, add it to a non-zero multiple of another row, and replace the original row with the resulting values.

3.	LU Factorization
4.	Takes given matrix and finds corresponding eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
